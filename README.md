# Weather Dashboard

## Installation

To use the Weather Dashboard, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of the city you want to get the weather information for in the input field.
2. Click the "Search" button or press the "Enter" key to fetch the weather data.
3. The current weather information for the selected city will be displayed, including the temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, feels like temperature, and pressure.

## API

The Weather Dashboard uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch the weather data. You will need to replace the `API_KEY` variable in the `index.html` file with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap.
